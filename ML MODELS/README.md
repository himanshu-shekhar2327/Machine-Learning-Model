# 📘 Machine Learning Practice Repository

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Practice Repository**!  
This repository contains my **hands-on implementation of machine learning concepts**, which I learned from **books, tutorials, and video lectures**.  
Each folder or notebook focuses on a specific ML topic, concept, or algorithm — from data preprocessing to advanced models.
